## 📘 Project Overview

This project documents a hands-on **Identity Governance** lab in **Microsoft Entra ID** focused on **access certification** and **third-party (guest) access control**.

The lab simulates a real enterprise scenario where contractor access must be reviewed and removed if no longer needed. It includes:

- Enterprise security group model
- Cloud-only users assigned to departments
- Guest user invited as a contractor
- Access Review configured for the contractor group
- Governance evidence captured via Entra audit logs

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an enterprise group model for department access
- Create cloud-only users and assign them using RBAC-style groups
- Invite an external guest user for contractor access
- Configure an Access Review for the contractor group
- Record access certification decisions (approve/deny)
- Validate governance activity with Entra audit logs

---

## 🧱 Environment

- **Directory:** Microsoft Entra ID Tenant
- **Groups:** Security groups (Assigned membership)
- **Users:** Cloud-only users + Guest user
- **Governance:** Identity Governance → Access Reviews
- **Evidence:** Audit Logs + Group membership validation

---

## 🏗 Architecture (High-Level)

Microsoft Entra ID Tenant  
→ Security Groups (HR / IT / Finance / Contractors)  
→ Users assigned to department groups  
→ Guest added to Contractors group  
→ Access Review certifies contractor access  
→ Audit logs record governance events

---

## ✅ Implementation Steps (Step-by-Step)

---

## 🔹 PHASE 1 — Environment Setup

### Step 1 — Create Enterprise Security Groups

**Path:** Azure Portal → Microsoft Entra ID → **Groups** → **New group**

Create the following groups:

- **ENT-HR-Users**
- **ENT-IT-Admins**
- **ENT-Finance-Users**
- **ENT-Contractors**

**Settings:**
- **Group type:** Security  
- **Membership type:** Assigned

---


### Step 2 — Create Cloud-Only Users + Assign Groups

**Path:** Microsoft Entra ID → **Users** → **New user**

Create at least:

- `alex.hr`
- `maria.finance`
- `kevin.it`

Assign each user to the correct group:

- `alex.hr` → **ENT-HR-Users**
- `maria.finance` → **ENT-Finance-Users**
- `kevin.it` → **ENT-IT-Admins** (or IT user group if you prefer)

## 🔹 PHASE 2 — Guest + Risk Scenario

### Step 3 — Invite a Guest User (Contractor)

**Path:** Microsoft Entra ID → **Users** → **New user** → **Invite external user**

- Invite a guest using one of your emails
- Add the guest user to: **ENT-Contractors**

**Purpose:** Simulates **vendor / third-party access**.

## 🔹 PHASE 3 — Identity Governance (Core Skill)

### Step 4 — Create an Access Review (Access Certification)

**Path:** Microsoft Entra ID → **Identity Governance** → **Access Reviews** → **New**

**Configuration:**
- **Review type:** Teams + Groups  
- **Select group:** **ENT-Contractors**  
- **Reviewers:** Group owners  
- **Frequency:** One time  
- **Duration:** 3 days  
- **On completion:**  
  - ✅ Auto-remove denied users  
  - ✅ Auto-apply results

### Step 5 — Start Review + Record Decision

**Path:** Identity Governance → Access Reviews → Open the review → **Results**

- Review the guest user in scope
- **Approve** or **Deny** access (based on your scenario)
- Capture evidence of the recorded decision

> Note: Depending on configuration, “Stop” may be unavailable while the review is within the scheduled review period. In that case, enforcement occurs automatically at review completion.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 4 — Evidence & Validation

### Step 6 — Confirm Membership Change (Removal or Retention)

**Path:** Microsoft Entra ID → **Groups** → **ENT-Contractors** → **Members**

Confirm whether the guest was:

- ✅ Removed (if denied + applied)  
or  
- ✅ Maintained (if approved or review not yet enforced)

### Step 7 — Capture Governance Audit Logs

**Path:** Microsoft Entra ID → **Monitoring** → **Audit logs**

Filter:
- **Category:** Identity Governance

Look for events related to:
- Access Review creation
- Access Review decision recorded
- Result application / membership change (if applicable)
